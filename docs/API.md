# API Documentation

---

## 1. Overview

This document defines the structure and documentation standard for all backend APIs in the TreeO2 project.

All APIs follow a module-based architecture.  
Each module represents a single API and contains its own routes, controller, service, and index file.

Swagger is used for interactive API documentation and testing.

Swagger UI:  
http://localhost:3000/api-docs

---

## 2. Module-Based API Structure

All APIs are organised under:

`src/modules/`

Each API has its own folder:

src/modules/
└── <module>/
    ├── <module>.routes.ts
    ├── <module>.controller.ts
    ├── <module>.service.ts
    └── index.ts

---

## 3. What Each File Contains

### <module>.routes.ts
Defines the API endpoints for the module and connects them to controller methods.

Responsibilities:
- Define route paths (e.g. GET /health, POST /users)
- Attach controller methods
- Import the module Swagger documentation file (<module>.docs.ts)

---

### <module>.docs.ts
Contains Swagger documentation for the module endpoints.

Responsibilities:
- Document API endpoints
- Define request parameters and request bodies
- Define response schemas and status codes
- Keep API documentation separate from route implementation logic

---

### <module>.controller.ts
Handles incoming requests and outgoing responses.

Responsibilities:
- Receive request data
- Validate and parse input where required
- Call the service layer
- Return HTTP responses

Must NOT contain:
- Business logic
- Database queries

---

### <module>.service.ts
Contains the core business logic for the API.

Responsibilities:
- Process data
- Implement business rules
- Interact with repositories or database layer

Must NOT:
- Use Express request/response objects

---

### index.ts
Exports the module routes so they can be used in app.ts.

Acts as the public entry point for the module.

Example:
export { default as healthRoutes } from "./health.routes";

---

## 4. How APIs Are Wired in the App

All module routes are registered in:

`src/app.ts`

Example:
import { healthRoutes } from "./modules/health";
app.use("/health", healthRoutes);

This keeps route registration centralised while keeping implementation modular.

---

## 5. Current API Modules

The backend currently includes the following API modules:

src/modules/
├── adopters
├── adoptions
├── dashboard-widgets
├── health
├── localization
├── partners
├── project-management
├── project-organisation
├── project-tree-types
├── reports
├── scan-batches
├── tree-scans
├── tree-types
├── user-management
└── user-project-assignment

Each module follows the same internal structure:

<module>/
├── <module>.routes.ts
├── <module>.controller.ts
├── <module>.service.ts
└──index.ts

Total:
- 14 API modules
- 56 files structured consistently across modules

---

## 6. Documentation Rule for New APIs

Whenever a new API is created:

- Use the existing module structure inside `src/modules/`
- Implement logic inside the already created files:
  - `<module>.routes.ts`
  - `<module>.controller.ts`
  - `<module>.service.ts`
  - `index.ts`
- Wire the routes in `app.ts`
- Add Swagger documentation for all endpoints using `<module>.docs.ts`
- Import the documentation file inside `<module>.routes.ts`
- Update this file to include the new module

---

## 7. Testing Standard

All modules should include the following test files:

tests/unit/<module>.test.ts  
tests/integration/<module>.test.ts

### Unit Tests
Used to test service/business logic in isolation.

Examples:
- Returned data is correct
- Validation logic works
- Business rules behave as expected

### Integration Tests
Used to test the full API flow:

route → controller → service → response

Examples:
- Correct HTTP status code
- Correct response body
- Endpoint behaves as expected

### Reference Example

Health module includes:

tests/unit/health.test.ts  
tests/integration/health.test.ts

All developers should add or update tests for the module they work on.

---

## 8. Health API

Reference implementation for module structure.

### Endpoints

#### GET /health

Response:
{ "success": true, "status": "OK", "timestamp": "..." }

Flow: routes → controller → service → response

Notes:
- Serves as the standard example for all modules
- Swagger is defined in `health.routes.ts`


## 9. USER MANAGEMENT API

This module manages users with role-based and project-based access control.

Module Path: `src/modules/user-management/`

---

### 9.1 Access Control

| Endpoint          | ADMIN | MANAGER (Scoped) | INSPECTOR | FARMER |
|------------------|-------|------------------|-----------|--------|
| GET /users       | Yes   | Yes              | No        | No     |
| GET /users/:id   | Yes   | Yes (project)    | Self      | Self   |
| POST /users      | Yes   | No               | No        | No     |
| PUT /users/:id   | Yes   | Yes (restricted) | No        | No     |
| DELETE /users/:id| Yes   | No               | No        | No     |

---

### 9.2 Manager Restrictions

Managers CAN:
- Update users within assigned projects

Managers CANNOT:
- Update roleId
- Update accountActive
- Update canSignIn

---

### 9.3 Validation Rules

- email must be valid format
- email must be unique (409)
- roleId must exist
- projectIds must:
  - be valid IDs
  - not contain duplicates

---

### 9.4 Endpoints

#### GET /users
Fetch users (Admin full access, Manager scoped by project)

#### GET /users/:id
Fetch single user with role-based access control

#### POST /users
Create user (Admin only)

#### PUT /users/:id
Update user (Admin full, Manager scoped with restrictions)

#### DELETE /users/:id
Soft delete user (Admin only)

---

### 9.5 Response Codes

- 200 OK
- 201 Created
- 400 Validation error
- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden
- 404 Not found
- 409 Conflict

---

### 9.6 Business Logic

- Prisma-based data access
- Soft delete (disable user instead of removing)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Project-scoped access for MANAGER
- Prevent deletion if user linked to treeScan records
---

## 10. Tree Types API

This section documents the `tree-types` module that has now been implemented and tested.

### Purpose

`tree-types` is a master/reference-data module used to manage tree species/type definitions in the backend.

It currently supports:
- listing all tree types
- fetching a single tree type by id
- creating a new tree type
- updating an existing tree type
- deleting a tree type when it is not referenced by dependent records

### Route Base

Current route base:

`/tree-types`

Examples:
- `GET /tree-types`
- `GET /tree-types/:id`
- `POST /tree-types`
- `PUT /tree-types/:id`
- `DELETE /tree-types/:id`

Swagger UI:

`http://localhost:3000/api-docs`

---

### Files Added / Updated

#### Module Files

- `src/modules/tree-types/treeTypes.routes.ts`
- `src/modules/tree-types/treeTypes.controller.ts`
- `src/modules/tree-types/treeTypes.service.ts`
- `src/modules/tree-types/treeTypes.schemas.ts`
- `src/modules/tree-types/treeTypes.docs.ts`
- `src/modules/tree-types/index.ts`

#### Route Registration

- `src/routes/index.ts`

#### Test Files

- `tests/integration/tree-types.test.ts`
- `tests/unit/tree-types.test.ts`

---

### Responsibility of Each File

#### `treeTypes.routes.ts`

Defines all `tree-types` endpoints and applies middleware in the current project pattern.

Current route protection:
- `GET` routes use `authMiddleware`
- `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` use `authMiddleware`
- `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` also use `roleMiddleware(["ADMIN"])`
- request validation is applied using `validateMiddleware(...)`

#### `treeTypes.controller.ts`

Receives validated requests and returns HTTP responses.

Current controller responsibilities:
- call the service layer
- return status codes
- return standard JSON success response shape

#### `treeTypes.service.ts`

Contains the actual business logic and Prisma usage.

Current service responsibilities:
- fetch tree types from Prisma
- fetch a tree type by id
- create tree type records
- update tree type records
- prevent deletion when referenced
- perform duplicate-key checks in service logic
- log create, update, and delete actions

#### `treeTypes.schemas.ts`

Contains Zod validation schemas for:
- path params
- create body
- update body
- delete params

#### `treeTypes.docs.ts`

Contains Swagger/OpenAPI annotations for:
- GET `/tree-types`
- GET `/tree-types/{id}`
- POST `/tree-types`
- PUT `/tree-types/{id}`
- DELETE `/tree-types/{id}`

Also defines request body schemas so Swagger UI shows body input for POST and PUT.

#### `index.ts`

Exports `treeTypesRoutes` as the module entry point.

#### `src/routes/index.ts`

Registers the module centrally:

`router.use("/tree-types", treeTypesRoutes);`

---

### Request Flow

#### A. GET `/tree-types`

Flow:

`routes -> authMiddleware -> controller -> service -> Prisma -> response`

Detailed flow:
1. request reaches `treeTypes.routes.ts`
2. `authMiddleware` checks bearer token using current auth scaffold
3. controller calls `listTreeTypes()`
4. service fetches tree types using Prisma
5. service maps DB fields to API response shape
6. controller returns `200 OK`

#### B. GET `/tree-types/:id`

Flow:

`routes -> authMiddleware -> validateMiddleware(treeTypeIdSchema) -> controller -> service -> Prisma -> response`

Detailed flow:
1. request reaches route with `:id`
2. `authMiddleware` checks authentication
3. `validateMiddleware` validates `id` as a positive integer
4. controller calls `getTreeTypeById(id)`
5. service fetches record
6. if missing, service throws `404`
7. controller returns `200 OK` when found

#### C. POST `/tree-types`

Flow:

`routes -> authMiddleware -> roleMiddleware(["ADMIN"]) -> validateMiddleware(createTreeTypeSchema) -> controller -> service -> Prisma -> response`

Detailed flow:
1. request reaches create route
2. `authMiddleware` checks authentication
3. `roleMiddleware(["ADMIN"])` checks Admin role using current scaffold
4. `validateMiddleware` validates request body
5. controller calls `createTreeType(payload)`
6. service checks duplicate key if provided
7. service applies default `dry_weight_density = 595` when omitted
8. service creates record using Prisma
9. service logs create action
10. controller returns `201 Created`

#### D. PUT `/tree-types/:id`

Flow:

`routes -> authMiddleware -> roleMiddleware(["ADMIN"]) -> validateMiddleware(updateTreeTypeSchema) -> controller -> service -> Prisma -> response`

Detailed flow:
1. request reaches update route
2. auth is checked
3. admin role is checked
4. request body is validated
5. controller calls `updateTreeType(id, payload)`
6. service checks record exists
7. service checks duplicate key if provided
8. service updates only provided fields
9. service logs update action
10. controller returns `200 OK`

#### E. DELETE `/tree-types/:id`

Flow:

`routes -> authMiddleware -> roleMiddleware(["ADMIN"]) -> validateMiddleware(deleteTreeTypeSchema) -> controller -> service -> Prisma -> response`

Detailed flow:
1. request reaches delete route
2. auth is checked
3. admin role is checked
4. `id` is validated
5. controller calls `deleteTreeType(id)`
6. service checks record exists
7. service checks references in:
   - `projectTreeType`
   - `treeScan`
8. if referenced, service throws `409 Conflict`
9. if safe, service deletes record
10. service logs delete action
11. controller returns `200 OK`

---

### Access Matrix

| Endpoint | Method | Auth Required | Role Required | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `/tree-types` | GET | Yes | Any authenticated role | Returns list |
| `/tree-types/:id` | GET | Yes | Any authenticated role | Returns single record |
| `/tree-types` | POST | Yes | `ADMIN` | Create new tree type |
| `/tree-types/:id` | PUT | Yes | `ADMIN` | Partial update allowed |
| `/tree-types/:id` | DELETE | Yes | `ADMIN` | Blocked if referenced |

Important note:
- access currently depends on the existing scaffolded auth/role middleware
- this module intentionally reuses that scaffold without redesigning it

---

### Tree Type Data Shape

Current API response shape:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Eucalyptus",
  "key": "eucalyptus",
  "scientific_name": "Eucalyptus globulus",
  "dry_weight_density": 650,
  "created_at": "2026-01-28T10:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-01-28T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Current business rules:
- `name` is required
- `key` is optional
- `scientific_name` is optional
- `dry_weight_density` is optional
- when omitted on create, `dry_weight_density` defaults to `595`
- delete is blocked when referenced by dependent records

---

### Validation Rules

#### Path Param Validation

`id` must be:
- numeric
- integer
- positive

Invalid examples:
- `abc`
- `0`
- `-1`

#### Create Validation

Accepted body example:

```json
{
  "name": "Eucalyptus",
  "key": "eucalyptus",
  "scientific_name": "Eucalyptus globulus",
  "dry_weight_density": 650
}
```

Rules:
- `name` must be non-empty after trim
- `key` if provided must be non-empty after trim
- `scientific_name` if provided must be non-empty after trim
- `dry_weight_density` if provided must be positive

#### Update Validation

Accepted body example:

```json
{
  "dry_weight_density": 640.5
}
```

Rules:
- partial updates are allowed
- empty body is rejected
- each provided field is validated

---

### Error Cases Handled

The module currently handles:

- missing token -> `401`
- non-admin mutation request -> `403`
- invalid `id` -> `400`
- missing required `name` -> `400`
- blank `name` -> `400`
- invalid `dry_weight_density` -> `400`
- empty update body -> `400`
- record not found -> `404`
- duplicate `key` -> `409`
- delete blocked due to references -> `409`

---

### Sorting Behaviour

Current list sorting:

- tree types are fetched with `orderBy: { name: "asc" }`

This means:
- response order is alphabetical by `name`
- response is not sorted by `id`

If a different sort order is needed later, it should be changed in:

`src/modules/tree-types/treeTypes.service.ts`

---

### Test Coverage Added

Two test files were implemented:

- `tests/integration/tree-types.test.ts`
- `tests/unit/tree-types.test.ts`

No separate schema-only test file was added because the repo does not currently have that as an established convention.

#### A. Integration Tests Covered

These tests exercise:

`route -> middleware -> controller -> service -> Prisma -> Postgres -> response`

Covered scenarios:

##### GET `/tree-types`
- returns `401` when token is missing
- returns `200` for authenticated user
- returns tree type list
- returns empty array when no records exist

##### GET `/tree-types/:id`
- returns `401` when token is missing
- returns `200` when record exists
- returns `400` for `abc`
- returns `400` for `0`
- returns `400` for negative id
- returns `404` when missing

##### POST `/tree-types`
- returns `401` when token is missing
- returns `403` for non-admin user
- returns `201` for admin valid request
- succeeds when only `name` is provided
- applies default density `595`
- returns `400` for missing `name`
- returns `400` for blank `name`
- returns `400` for invalid density
- returns `400` when `name` exceeds DB length limit
- returns `400` when `key` exceeds DB length limit
- returns `400` when `scientific_name` exceeds DB length limit
- returns `409` for duplicate `key`

##### PUT `/tree-types/:id`
- returns `401` when token is missing
- returns `403` for non-admin user
- returns `200` for valid partial update
- updates only provided fields
- returns `400` for invalid id
- returns `400` for empty body
- returns `400` for invalid values
- returns `400` when updated `name` exceeds DB length limit
- returns `400` when updated `key` exceeds DB length limit
- returns `400` when updated `scientific_name` exceeds DB length limit
- returns `404` when missing
- returns `409` for duplicate `key`

##### DELETE `/tree-types/:id`
- returns `401` when token is missing
- returns `403` for non-admin user
- returns success for valid admin delete
- returns `400` for invalid id
- returns `404` when missing
- returns `409` when referenced by `projectTreeType`
- returns `409` when referenced by `treeScan`
- verifies delete is not executed on conflict

#### B. Unit Tests Covered

These tests exercise the service layer directly.

Covered scenarios:

##### `listTreeTypes`
- returns mapped records
- returns empty array

##### `getTreeTypeById`
- returns mapped record
- throws not found when missing

##### `createTreeType`
- succeeds with full payload
- succeeds with only required `name`
- applies default density
- blocks duplicate key

##### `updateTreeType`
- updates only provided fields
- throws not found when record missing

##### `deleteTreeType`
- succeeds when record is not referenced
- blocks delete when referenced by `projectTreeType`
- blocks delete when referenced by `treeScan`

---

### Test Strategy Used

Current test strategy for this module:

- Jest is used as the test runner
- integration tests use `supertest`
- the main `tree-types` integration suite uses the real Prisma client and real Postgres-backed data
- logger is mocked in tests
- integration auth behaviour uses the current development auth scaffold

This matches the current repo state where:
- Jest is already configured
- test files already live under `tests/unit` and `tests/integration`
- CI provisions a Postgres test database and applies the Prisma schema before tests
- the `tree-types` API integration suite creates and cleans up its own test data

---

### How To Run Tree Types Tests

Run unit tests only:

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand tests/unit/tree-types.test.ts
```

Run integration tests only:

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand tests/integration/tree-types.test.ts
```

Run both:

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand tests/unit/tree-types.test.ts tests/integration/tree-types.test.ts
```

---

### Current Limitations

- auth and role checks depend on the existing scaffold and are not fully production-complete yet
- duplicate key protection is currently handled in service logic, not by a visible DB uniqueness constraint
- there is not yet a dedicated `project-tree-types` deletion/assignment workflow connected to this document beyond reference checks

---

### Summary

The `tree-types` module is now fully wired into the backend with:
- route registration
- controller/service separation
- Zod validation
- Swagger documentation
- authenticated read access
- admin-only mutation access
- reference-safe delete behavior
- unit test coverage
- real DB-backed API integration coverage

This module now serves as one of the more complete examples of the project’s current module-based API structure and can be used as a reference for implementing similar CRUD-style master-data APIs.

## 11. Project Management API

## 12. Project Organisation API

This module manages project-organisation sharing relationships. It allows organisations to be linked to projects with configurable access types.

**Module Path:** `src/modules/project-organisation/`

### Files
- `projectOrganisation.routes.ts`
- `projectOrganisation.controller.ts`
- `projectOrganisation.service.ts`
- `projectOrganisation.schema.ts`
- `projectOrganisation.docs.ts`

### 12.1 Purpose

The Project Organisation API manages the relationship between projects and organisations. It enables:
- Linking an organisation to a project with a specific access type
- Retrieving all project-organisation relationships
- Removing a project-organisation sharing link

Access types:
- `owner` — primary organisation that created the project (set during project creation, not managed by this API)
- `shared` — read and write access (default)
- `partner` — partner-level access

### 12.2 Architecture Flow

```text
Route → Controller → Service → Prisma ORM → PostgreSQL → Response
```

**Routes** (`projectOrganisation.routes.ts`)
- Define endpoints
- Apply `authMiddleware` and `validateMiddleware`
- Contain Swagger documentation (imported from `projectOrganisation.docs.ts`)

**Controller**
- Receive request data
- Parse params and body using Zod schemas
- Call service methods
- Return HTTP responses

**Service**
- Validate project and organisation existence
- Enforce business rules (cannot create/delete `owner` access type)
- Execute database queries
- Throw structured errors

### 12.3 Security

All endpoints are protected using Bearer Token authentication.

Middleware used:
- `authMiddleware`

> **Note:** Permission-based middleware is not yet implemented. See T2-2026 API13.

### 12.4 Access Control Matrix

> **Note:** Permission-based middleware is not yet implemented. See T2-2026 API13. This section might not exist in the future.

- `500` System error

#### DELETE /project-organisations/:projectId/:organisationId

Remove a project-organisation sharing link.

##### Path Parameters
| Name | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| projectId | integer | Yes |
| organisationId | integer | Yes |

##### Response
```json
{
  "success": true,

- `401` Authentication required
- `404` Project-organisation sharing link not found
- `422` Cannot remove `owner` access type
- `500` System error

### 12.6 Business Rules

- `owner` access type cannot be created or deleted through this API. It is set during project creation via `ownerOrganisationId`. Deletion of `owner` access type happens through cascade on FK deletion.
- Both project and organisation must exist before a relationship can be created.
- Duplicate project-organisation relationships are prevented by a unique constraint on `(project_id, organisation_id)`.
- On deletion, affected users' refresh tokens are revoked (pending T2-2026 API13).

## 14. Project Tree Types API

This section documents the `project-tree-types` module that has now been implemented and tested.

### Purpose

`project-tree-types` is the junction/mapping module between projects and tree types.

It is used to define which tree types are assigned to a specific project and is intended to support later validation in downstream modules such as `tree-scans`.

It currently supports:
- listing project/tree-type assignments
- filtering assignments by `project_id`
- assigning a tree type to a project
- removing a tree type assignment from a project

### Route Base

Current route base:

`/project-tree-types`

Examples:
- `GET /project-tree-types`
- `GET /project-tree-types?project_id=1`
- `POST /project-tree-types`
- `DELETE /project-tree-types/:project_id/:tree_type_id`

Swagger UI:

`http://localhost:3000/api-docs`

---

### Files Added / Updated

#### Module Files

- `src/modules/project-tree-types/projectTreeTypes.routes.ts`
- `src/modules/project-tree-types/projectTreeTypes.controller.ts`
- `src/modules/project-tree-types/projectTreeTypes.service.ts`
- `src/modules/project-tree-types/projectTreeTypes.schemas.ts`
- `src/modules/project-tree-types/projectTreeTypes.docs.ts`
- `src/modules/project-tree-types/index.ts`

#### Route Registration

- `src/routes/index.ts`

#### Test Files

- `tests/integration/project-tree-types.test.ts`
- `tests/unit/project-tree-types.test.ts`

---

### Responsibility of Each File

#### `projectTreeTypes.routes.ts`

Defines all `project-tree-types` endpoints and applies middleware in the current project pattern.

Current route protection:
- `GET` uses `authMiddleware`
- `GET` also uses `roleMiddleware(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"])`
- `POST` uses `authMiddleware`
- `POST` also uses `roleMiddleware(["ADMIN"])`
- `DELETE` uses `authMiddleware`
- `DELETE` also uses `roleMiddleware(["ADMIN"])`
- request validation is applied using `validateMiddleware(...)`

#### `projectTreeTypes.controller.ts`

Receives validated requests and returns HTTP responses.

Current controller responsibilities:
- call the service layer
- return status codes
- return standard JSON success response shape

#### `projectTreeTypes.service.ts`

Contains the actual business logic and Prisma usage.

Current service responsibilities:
- fetch project/tree-type mappings from Prisma
- optionally filter mappings by `project_id`
- verify referenced project exists before create
- verify referenced tree type exists before create
- prevent duplicate mapping creation
- create project/tree-type assignments
- delete project/tree-type assignments
- map Prisma response fields to API response shape
- log create and delete actions

#### `projectTreeTypes.schemas.ts`

Contains Zod validation schemas for:
- list query params
- create body
- delete path params

#### `projectTreeTypes.docs.ts`

Contains Swagger/OpenAPI annotations for:
- GET `/project-tree-types`
- POST `/project-tree-types`
- DELETE `/project-tree-types/{project_id}/{tree_type_id}`

Also defines request body/query/path parameter documentation so Swagger UI shows the required input correctly.

#### `index.ts`

Exports `projectTreeTypesRoutes` as the module entry point.

#### `src/routes/index.ts`

Registers the module centrally:

`router.use("/project-tree-types", projectTreeTypesRoutes);`

---

### Request Flow

#### A. GET `/project-tree-types`

Flow:

`routes -> authMiddleware -> roleMiddleware(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"]) -> validateMiddleware(listProjectTreeTypesSchema) -> controller -> service -> Prisma -> response`

Detailed flow:
1. request reaches `projectTreeTypes.routes.ts`
2. `authMiddleware` checks bearer token using current auth scaffold
3. `roleMiddleware(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"])` checks role using current scaffold
4. `validateMiddleware` validates optional `project_id` query param
5. controller calls `listProjectTreeTypes(query)`
6. service fetches mappings from Prisma
7. service includes related `project` and `treeType` data
8. service maps DB fields to API response shape
9. controller returns `200 OK`

#### B. POST `/project-tree-types`

Flow:

`routes -> authMiddleware -> roleMiddleware(["ADMIN"]) -> validateMiddleware(createProjectTreeTypeSchema) -> controller -> service -> Prisma -> response`

Detailed flow:
1. request reaches create route
2. `authMiddleware` checks authentication
3. `roleMiddleware(["ADMIN"])` checks Admin role using current scaffold
4. `validateMiddleware` validates request body
5. controller calls `addProjectTreeType(payload)`
6. service checks project exists
7. service checks tree type exists
8. service checks duplicate mapping
9. service creates mapping using Prisma
10. service logs create action
11. controller returns `201 Created`

#### C. DELETE `/project-tree-types/:project_id/:tree_type_id`

Flow:

`routes -> authMiddleware -> roleMiddleware(["ADMIN"]) -> validateMiddleware(deleteProjectTreeTypeSchema) -> controller -> service -> Prisma -> response`

Detailed flow:
1. request reaches delete route
2. auth is checked
3. admin role is checked
4. `project_id` and `tree_type_id` are validated
5. controller calls `removeProjectTreeType(projectId, treeTypeId)`
6. service checks mapping exists
7. service deletes mapping
8. service logs delete action
9. controller returns `200 OK`

---

### Access Matrix

| Endpoint | Method | Auth Required | Role Required | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `/project-tree-types` | GET | Yes | `ADMIN`, `MANAGER` | Optional `project_id` filter |
| `/project-tree-types` | POST | Yes | `ADMIN` | Assign tree type to project |
| `/project-tree-types/:project_id/:tree_type_id` | DELETE | Yes | `ADMIN` | Remove assignment |

Important note:
- access currently depends on the existing scaffolded auth/role middleware
- this module intentionally reuses that scaffold without redesigning it
- Manager access is role-based only at this stage and is not yet project-scoped

---

### Project Tree Type Data Shape

Current API response shape:

```json
{
  "project_id": 1,
  "tree_type_id": 3,
  "project": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Northern NSW Reforestation"
  },
  "tree_type": {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Mahogany",
    "key": "mahogany",
    "scientific_name": "Swietenia macrophylla",
    "dry_weight_density": 550
  }
}
```

Current business rules:
- `project_id` is required for create
- `tree_type_id` is required for create
- project must exist before assignment is created
- tree type must exist before assignment is created
- duplicate `(project_id, tree_type_id)` mapping is blocked
- delete currently removes an existing mapping if found

---

### Validation Rules

#### Query Validation

`project_id` is optional for list requests.

If provided, it must be:
- numeric
- integer
- positive

Invalid examples:
- `abc`
- `0`
- `-1`

#### Create Validation

Accepted body example:

```json
{
  "project_id": 1,
  "tree_type_id": 3
}
```

Rules:
- `project_id` is required
- `tree_type_id` is required
- both values must be positive integers

#### Delete Param Validation

Both path params are required:
- `project_id`
- `tree_type_id`

Rules:
- both must be numeric
- both must be integers
- both must be positive

---

### Error Cases Handled

The module currently handles:

- missing token -> `401`
- authenticated role outside Admin/Manager on GET -> `403`
- non-admin mutation request -> `403`
- invalid `project_id` query -> `400`
- missing body fields on create -> `400`
- invalid body ids on create -> `400`
- invalid path params on delete -> `400`
- project not found -> `404`
- tree type not found -> `404`
- mapping not found on delete -> `404`
- duplicate mapping -> `409`

---

### Sorting Behaviour

Current list sorting:

- mappings are fetched with `orderBy: [{ projectId: "asc" }, { treeTypeId: "asc" }]`

This means:
- mappings are grouped in ascending `project_id` order
- within a project, mappings are ordered by ascending `tree_type_id`

If a different sort order is needed later, it should be changed in:

`src/modules/project-tree-types/projectTreeTypes.service.ts`

---

### Test Coverage Added

Two test files are currently used for this module:

- `tests/integration/project-tree-types.test.ts`
- `tests/unit/project-tree-types.test.ts`

No separate schema-only test file was added because the repo does not currently have that as an established convention.

#### A. Integration Tests Covered

This suite now exercises the full runtime path:

`route -> middleware -> controller -> service -> Prisma -> Postgres -> response`

Covered scenarios:

##### GET `/project-tree-types`
- returns `401` when token is missing
- returns `403` for authenticated role outside Admin/Manager
- returns `200` for Admin
- returns `200` for Manager
- returns mapped records
- returns empty array for a project filter when no mappings exist
- applies `project_id` filtering when provided
- returns `400` for invalid `project_id` query

##### POST `/project-tree-types`
- returns `401` when token is missing
- returns `403` for non-admin user
- returns `201` for valid admin request
- returns `400` when body fields are missing
- returns `400` for invalid ids
- returns `404` when project is missing
- returns `404` when tree type is missing
- returns `409` when mapping already exists

##### DELETE `/project-tree-types/:project_id/:tree_type_id`
- returns `401` when token is missing
- returns `403` for non-admin user
- returns `200` for valid admin delete
- returns `400` for invalid path params
- returns `404` when mapping is missing

#### B. Unit Tests Covered

These tests exercise the service layer directly.

Covered scenarios:

##### `listProjectTreeTypes`
- returns mapped assignments
- applies `project_id` filter
- returns empty array

##### `addProjectTreeType`
- creates mapping successfully
- throws when project does not exist
- throws when tree type does not exist
- throws conflict when mapping already exists
- maps DB uniqueness violation to conflict

##### `removeProjectTreeType`
- deletes an existing mapping successfully
- throws not found when mapping is missing
- logs delete action

### Test Strategy Used

Current test strategy for this module:

- Jest is used as the test runner
- integration tests use `supertest`
- the main integration suite uses real Prisma and a real Postgres database
- logger is mocked in unit/integration tests
- integration auth behaviour uses the current development auth scaffold
- the integration suite assumes a reachable `DATABASE_URL` and an already-synced Prisma schema

This matches the current repo state where:
- Jest is already configured
- test files already live under `tests/unit` and `tests/integration`
- the integration suite creates and cleans up its own fixture data

---

### How To Run Project Tree Types Tests

Run unit tests only:

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand tests/unit/project-tree-types.test.ts
```

Before running the integration tests:

- make sure Postgres is running
- make sure `DATABASE_URL` points to the test database
- make sure the Prisma schema is already applied

Typical local setup:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:push
```

Run integration tests only:

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand tests/integration/project-tree-types.test.ts
```

Run all `project-tree-types` tests:

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand tests/unit/project-tree-types.test.ts tests/integration/project-tree-types.test.ts
```

---

### Current Limitations

- auth and role checks depend on the existing scaffold and are not fully production-complete yet
- Manager read access is not project-scoped at this stage
- current delete behaviour does not yet block removal based on future `tree-scans` business rules because that rule has not been finalized in the current codebase

---

### Summary

The `project-tree-types` module is now fully wired into the backend with:
- route registration
- controller/service separation
- Zod validation
- Swagger documentation
- Admin/Manager read access
- admin-only mutation access
- duplicate-assignment protection
- unit and real DB-backed API integration test coverage

This module now provides the project-to-tree-type assignment layer needed before downstream modules such as `tree-scans` can validate whether a scanned tree type is allowed for a given project.

## 15. User-Project Assignment API

This module manages the assignment relationship between users and projects in the TreeO2 platform. It allows authorised users to view user-project assignments, assign users to projects, and remove users from projects.

**Module Path:** `src/modules/user-project-assignment/`

### Files
- `userProjectAssignment.routes.ts`
- `userProjectAssignment.controller.ts`
- `userProjectAssignment.service.ts`
- `index.ts`

### 14.1 Purpose

The User-Project Assignment API is responsible for managing which users are connected to which projects.

This is important because projects need assigned users such as:
- Managers
- Inspectors
- Farmers
- Other project-related users

The module does not create users or projects. It only manages the relationship between existing users and existing projects.

### 14.2 Architecture Flow

Every request follows the standard backend module structure:

```text
Route → Controller → Service → Prisma ORM → PostgreSQL → Response
```

#### Responsibilities

#### Routes
- Define endpoints
- Apply authentication middleware
- Apply role-based authorization
- Contain Swagger documentation

#### Controller
- Receive request data
- Read params/body
- Call service methods
- Return HTTP response

#### Service
- Validate user and project IDs
- Check whether user exists
- Check whether project exists
- Check duplicate assignments
- Execute create/delete database operations
- Throw structured errors

### 14.3 Security

All endpoints are protected using Bearer Token authentication.

Middleware used:
- `authMiddleware`
- `roleMiddleware`

### 14.4 Access Control Matrix

| Endpoint | ADMIN | MANAGER | INSPECTOR | FARMER | DEVELOPER |

- Coordinates must be within valid latitude/longitude ranges
- Decimal measurements must be positive
- UUID fields must be valid UUIDs

- `isCorrected` cannot be provided by the client
- `correctedBy` cannot be provided by the client

#### Relationship Validation
- Project must exist

---

### 16.7 Error Handling

Uses centralised error middleware.

#### Standard Error Response

```json
{

### 16.8 Audit Logging

Tree scan corrections create audit records using transactional writes.

The following operations are executed within a Prisma transaction:
- Tree scan update
- Audit log creation

This ensures both operations either succeed together or fail together.

Audit data is explicitly converted into JSON-safe values before insertion into JSONB fields to avoid unsafe casting of Prisma results containing dates, decimals, or nested relation objects.

  "scans": [
    {
      "fob_id": "SWAGGER-001",
      "farmer_id": 16,
      "species_id": 1,
      "estimated_planted_year": 2024,
      "estimated_planted_month": 5,
      "planted_date": "2024-05-20",
      "height_m": 2.5,
      "circumference_cm": 45.3,
      "diameter_cm": 14.4,
      "latitude": -8.5569,

      "client_scan_id": "7b9c1e42-2b1e-4f0a-9c3a-1d2e3f4a5b6c",
      "scan_timestamp": "2024-05-20T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Required Fields
- `project_id`
- `device_id` (batch level; identifies the uploading device)
- `scans`
- `fob_id`
- `farmer_id`
- `species_id`
- `estimated_planted_year`
- `estimated_planted_month`
- `client_scan_id` (per scan; device-generated UUID)

##### Offline Idempotency

Offline scan uploads are idempotent. Each scan carries a device-generated
`client_scan_id` (UUID), and the pair is stored under the unique key
`(project_id, inspector_id, device_id, client_scan_id)`. If a batch is
re-sent — for example after a network timeout or reconnect — scans that
already exist are detected and skipped, so no duplicate scan records are
created. `scan_timestamp` records when the scan was captured on the device
and cannot be in the future.

Each response includes a `summary` reporting how many scans were `created`
versus `skipped`.

##### Response

New scans created (some may be skipped duplicates):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Scan batch uploaded successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "inspectorId": 4,
    "projectId": 1,
    "deviceId": "MOB-001",
    "treeScans": []
  },
  "summary": {
    "created": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "skippedClientScanIds": []
  }
}
```

Idempotent retry where every submitted scan already exists (no new batch is
created):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "All submitted scans already exist. No new scans were created.",
  "data": null,
  "summary": {
    "created": 0,
    "skipped": 1,
    "skippedClientScanIds": ["7b9c1e42-2b1e-4f0a-9c3a-1d2e3f4a5b6c"]
  }
}
```

##### Status Codes
- `201` Created (one or more new scans inserted)
- `200` Idempotent no-op (all submitted scans already existed)
- `400` Validation failed (includes missing/invalid `client_scan_id` or
  `device_id`, future `scan_timestamp`, or duplicate `client_scan_id` within
  the batch)
- `401` Authentication required
- `403` Insufficient permissions
- `404` Related entity not found

## 22. User Organisation Roles API

This module manages role assignments for users within organisations in the TreeO2 platform. It allows assigning and removing organisation roles to users who are members of those organisations.

**Module Path:** `src/modules/user-organisation-roles/`

### Files

- `userOrganisationRoles.routes.ts`
- `userOrganisationRoles.controller.ts`
- `userOrganisationRoles.service.ts`
- `userOrganisationRoles.schema.ts`
- `userOrganisationRoles.docs.ts`
- `index.ts`

### 22.1 Purpose

The User Organisation Roles API is responsible for managing role assignments between users and organisations.

This module handles:

- Assigning an organisation role to a user within a specific organisation
- Removing a specific role assignment from a user within an organisation

Prerequisites:

- The user must already be a member of the organisation (a `user_organisation` record must exist)
- The organisation role must exist in the `organisation_roles` table

### 22.2 Architecture Flow

Every request follows the standard backend module structure:

```
Route → Controller → Service → Prisma ORM → PostgreSQL → Response
```

#### Responsibilities

#### Routes

- Define endpoints
- Apply authentication middleware
- Apply validation middleware
- Contain Swagger documentation

#### Controller

- Receive request data
- Read params/body
- Call service methods
- Return HTTP responses

#### Service

- Validate user-organisation membership exists
- Validate organisation role exists
- Execute database queries
- Handle composite primary key constraints
- Throw structured errors

### 22.3 Security

All endpoints are protected using Bearer Token authentication.

Middleware used:

- `authMiddleware`

> **Note:** Permission-based middleware is not yet implemented. Any authenticated user can perform all operations. See T2-2026 API12.

### 22.4 Access Control Matrix

> **Note:** Permission-based middleware is not yet implemented. This section may not reflect final access control rules.

### 22.5 Endpoints

### 22.6 Validation Rules

#### Create Validation

- `userId` must be a positive integer
- `organisationId` must be a positive integer
- `roleId` must be a positive integer
- User-organisation membership must exist before role assignment
- Organisation role must exist before role assignment
- Duplicate `(userId, organisationId, roleId)` assignments are prevented by the composite primary key

#### Delete Validation

- `userId` must be a positive integer
- `organisationId` must be a positive integer
- `roleId` must be a positive integer
- Role assignment must exist before deletion

### 22.7 Business Rules

- The user must already be a member of the organisation (a `user_organisation` record must exist) before a role can be assigned.
- The organisation role must exist in the `organisation_roles` table.
- Duplicate role assignments are prevented by the composite primary key on `(user_id, organisation_id, role_id)`.
- Role hierarchy checks for assignment and removal are pending (see T2-2026 API12).
- Refresh token revocation on role removal is pending (see T2-2026 API12).
